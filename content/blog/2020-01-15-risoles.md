> Risoles is one of popular appetizers in Indonesia. It looks similar with spring rolls but the how to make it is a little bit different. Also the taste. In Indonesia you can easily get this snack without even bother to spend your time in the kitchen. They sell it in the market, bakery, or even along the street. The name Risoles is borrowed over from the traditional Portuguese rissole. A rissole is a small croquette, enclosed in pastry or rolled in breadcrumbs, usually baked or deep fried. It is filled with sweet or savoury ingredients, most often minced meat or fish, and is served as an entrÃ©e, dessert or side dish.
